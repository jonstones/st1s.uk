The best way to explain this to any organization is to present the gorilla experiment. This is a fabled story thats been used many times. It goes like this…

The experiment begins with five gorillas in a cage. In the center of the cage is a banana, hanging at the top of the cage just out of the gorilla’s reach. Below the mouthwatering banana is a ladder.

As one of the gorillas begins to climb the ladder toward the banana, all five gorillas are sprayed with ice-cold water. All of the gorillas immediately retreat to the corners of the cage at which point the water stops spraying.

After a short time, another gorilla began to climb the ladder and was stopped by the other four who did not want to be doused with water.

One of the gorillas is removed from the cage and replaced with a new one. As soon as the newby sees the banana, he goes for it. Enroute, he is attacked by the other gorillas. He has no idea why, but fully understands that he will be assaulted if he tries to climb the ladder.

A second gorilla is removed from the cage and replaced with a new one. Of course, the new gorilla makes a dash for the ladder and is attacked. The first newcomer joins in the assault, even though he does not understand the reason for it.

A third gorilla is replaced and the same events unfold, this time with the first two replacements participating in the assault with no idea why.

After the last two original gorillas are replaced, no gorillas who were sprayed with water remain. The new five, with no knowledge of why they should not approach the ladder, will never touch the ladder or make a climb for the beautiful banana. Why? "Because that’s the way it’s always been around here."
