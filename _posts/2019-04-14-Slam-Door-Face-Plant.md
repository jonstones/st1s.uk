Brighton has a fairly long platform, about 3 times longer than most stations. We were on one of the old slam door trains, and queuing by the door ready to get off.

The train comes into the station and gradually slows until it comes to rest by the ticket office, taking 2 or 3 minutes to do so.

On this particular day, we are still moving at quite a pace as we begin passing the platform. 

Due to the fact that the platform is a universal grey tarmac and wide, our actual speed is deceptive. The gentleman in front, and charged with opening the door for us all, was clearly in a rush. I was second in line. 

No sooner had the train started passing the platform, the man opened the window. He reached out, unlocked the door, and opened it half way.. he paused for a couple of seconds to judge 'his environment'... all safe.. and he stepped off the train...

Just as his feet touched the platform, they were whipped out from under him. In a panic the man manages to get his arm through the window, and start hanging onto the open door.

Being dragged down the platform, scuffing his posh black shoes.. "How long can he hold on for?" is going through my head. There is nothing I can do to help.. if he just stays hanging on, then he can recover his dignity when the train slows some more.

Nope, he can't hold on any longer, and he decides to let go. He glances at me with a blank expression on his face... "Yeah.. I'm still in control. I know what I'm doing".

Smack! He slaps the tarmac with his face, tumbles head-to-toe a few times, and comes to rest, star shaped, face down, jacket all torn. His briefcase hits the tarmac and explodes. His Lunch box also explodes. His laptop comes apart into its component pieces... phone the same.. papers and pens everywhere.

The train gracefully just carries on with its routine quietly coming to a stop about 30secs later. The announcement sarcastically says "Welcome to Brighton Station!". 

I step off, and look back down the platform at the large puddle of carnage that is strewn half way down the platform. What a mess!

The very full train now empties itself, and the whole platform becomes swamped with people, and I hope someone helped the poor man!

Moral of the story.. learn from other people's mistakes!! :)
