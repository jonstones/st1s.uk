Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson went on a Camping Trip.

In the middle of the night, Holmes woke, and nudged his faithful friend...
"Watson, look up into the sky and tell me what you see?"
Watson replied "I see millions and millions of stars..", he said stating the obvious!
"What does that tell you, Watson?".
"Well Astronomically it tells me there are millions of galaxies, and potentially billions of planets.."
"Horologically, I deduce that the time is a quarter past three.."
"Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. Why, what does it tell you?"
Holmes was silent for a moment, and then said "Watson, you've missed the obvious. Someone's nicked the tent!!"
