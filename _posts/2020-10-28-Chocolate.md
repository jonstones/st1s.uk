In Genevieve’s opinion there were 4 food groups: Milk Chocolate, White Chocolate, Dark Chocolate and Chocolate Truffles, if any of these food groups contained fruit, this was a bonus, she had had 1 of her 5 a day.

Birthdays, Christmas and especially Easter were made very easy for her friends and family, they new exactly what to buy, chocolate, but more specifically fortnum and masons chocolate. The arrival of the eau du nil boxes and wicker hampers filled with chocolaty delights always put a spring in her step months before any celebration, the thought of dark chocolate caviar and champagne truffles would lure Genevieve into the sweet filled chocolate amphitheater, when she felt the red velvet carpet under foot she knew she had entered her heaven. Having treated herself to a box of rose and violet creams, she found herself skipping down Piccadilly towards the tube that would whisk her home to write her list of chocolatey desires for her upcoming birthday, the date was 15th March.

When Genevieve woke her world came crashing down, the UK and her beloved chocolate were in lockdown. She could feel the panic start to rise and why had she devoured the whole box of chocolates within 5 minutes of her tube ride home.

She jumped on her computer and started to google: Chocolate delivery, fortums delivery slots, emergency chocolate supplies but all to no avail. As the days turned into weeks and her birthday grew closer her searches became more desperate, how to grow your own cocoa on in a window box and her darkest moment how to break into Fortum and Masons. She turned her computer off.

April 29th arrived, her birthday. Her morning was filled with zoom calls from loved ones, opening cards and presents of ‘other’ chocolate from well meaning family members, but nothing filled the desire for her beloved chocolate. As the day turned into evening, Genevieve poured herself a glass of wine and settled down to watch her favourite birthday movie, Charlie and the chocolate factory. There was a knock at the door, she felt heavy getting of the sofa this year it was sadness not the vast quantities of chocolate she would have usually devoured. As she opened it she couldn’t believe her eyes, on her doorstep was a box, printed on the side was the words Fortum and Masons. Her heart lept she grabbed the box, ran inside and placed it on her dining table, keeping her fingers crossed it was not a joke gift of pork pie, that was her sisters favourite, she ripped open the box and inside was her hamper, a hamper filled with chocolate and a note, Love Mum x

She reached for her favourite pralines and popped one in her mouth, it was a velvety, nutty chocolate hug that she had longed for and needed for weeks, she called her mum, “how, how did you do this?” Her response was simple. “My darling I book your birthday delivery at Christmas, I look forward to the day you were born as much as you look forward to chocolate”. At this moment she realised no matter how much she loved chocolate, she loved her mum the most.
